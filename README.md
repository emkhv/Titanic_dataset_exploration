# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for beginner machine learning projects due to its relatively small size and clear objective.

## Introduction

This project serves as an introduction to machine learning for beginners. The main goal is to achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 75% while exploring different techniques and understanding the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Resources

- Kaggle: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Medium Article: [Getting Started with Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://medium.com/@kaggle/getting-started-with-titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-6cb439b2143e)

## Goals

- Gain familiarity with data analysis and visualization techniques.
- Understand the basics of machine learning algorithms and their application.
- Achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 75%.
- Have fun learning and exploring the world of machine learning!

## Libraries 

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and consists of two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`, containing training and test data, respectively.

## Data Exploration

- Analyzed missing values using heatmap visualization.
- Explored survival rates by age, gender, passenger class, and fare.

## Data Preprocessing

- Imputed missing values for 'Embarked' and 'Age' columns.
- Created new features like 'Pclass_category', 'Fare_category', and 'New_Cabin'.
- Visualized survival rates by age band.


## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the process of building and evaluating machine learning models. Although the primary goal was to achieve a prediction accuracy of at least 75%, the learning journey was the main focus.
